# Time of cooling using FDHM
Estimate the timing of initial cooling in a QTQt time-temperature inversion by the full duration at half-maximum (FDHM) method. The FDHM is chosen as the half-maximum isotherm for the total observed/modeled cooling signal within a [time] window of interest. The output is a distribution of the interpolated QTQt model times at which each time-temperature path passes through the selected isotherm.
